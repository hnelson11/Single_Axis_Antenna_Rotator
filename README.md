# Single_Axis_Antenna_Rotator

Modern day technological advancements utilize techniques in dual axis antenna rotator systems for satellite tracking purposes. System designs similar to these demonstrate limitations through expense and accessibility. This report describes a design for an open-source single axis antenna rotator system. This system consists of a weather-proofed exterior and an embedded system packet tracking interior. The open-source single axis antenna system is more accessible through an open-source design format, more accurate through a high resolution tracking system, and simpler to use through part availability. We recommend using a basic 3-D printer and mechanical equipment while constructing this system.
